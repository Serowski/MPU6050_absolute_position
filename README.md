This program was develpoed for the sole purpose of testing my acquired skills. 
As the name suggests it takes the sensor values from the MPU6050 and calculates the absoulte position of the board in XYZ coordinates.
I've modified the code to use it as an controller outputting the changes in XYZ positions as 'wsad' movement.
The additional buttons act as left and right mouse buttons.
The microcontroller board used in this project is Arsuino Micro, capable of connecting to a computer as a HID device.
