This program was developed specifically to evaluate the skills I have acquired. As the name implies, it captures sensor data from the MPU6050 module and computes the absolute orientation of the board in terms of XYZ coordinates.

The code has been customized to function as a controller, translating changes in XYZ positions into corresponding 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' movements. Furthermore, additional buttons on the setup are configured to emulate the left and right mouse buttons.

The microcontroller employed in this project is the Arduino Micro, which has the capability to interface with a computer as a Human Interface Device (HID).
